#LABOR - Conventional Release Action

A github action that generates a CHANGELOG.md and updates your package.json as well as the composer.json of your project after you pushed a new release.

This library aims to provide with an automatic release cycle based on [Conventional Changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog) and [angular's commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines). Both provide tools to keep the git history readable, generate version numbers and changelogs automatically.
